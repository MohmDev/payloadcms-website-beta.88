### Usage
Once your template is deployed, it should work out of the box without needing additional configuration. After deployment, navigate to your application's URL. You'll find an empty website. That is because there is no data in the database yet.
You'll find instructions on your screen to set up your admin account. After creating your account, you'll have access to the admin panel and you can seed the database with a few pages, posts, and projects.<br>

Once you are done seeding your database, simply refresh your application's homepage and enjoy your Full-stack Next.js 15 website powered by PayloadCMS.
